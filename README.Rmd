## Installation

You can install the development version of **YoloHealthApp** from source by following the instructions below.

First, navigate to the [**releases**](https://github.com/Data-Visualization-for-Family-Health/YoloHealthApp/releases) page of this Github repository and download the latest tar.gz asset (currently [YoloHealthApp_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz](https://github.com/Data-Visualization-for-Family-Health/YoloHealthApp/releases/download/0.0.0.9000/YoloHealthApp_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz))

Next, use the following R command to install the YoloHealthApp package from source:

``` r
install.packages("path/to/YoloHealthApp_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz") # Change "path/to" to your download location.
```

You can now launch the app as follows:

``` r
YoloHealthApp::runApp()
```

### Installation on a Shiny server

**YoloHealthApp** first needs to be installed using the above instructions. This will install all R dependencies needed for the app as well as the necessary data.

The `site_dir` variable of the Shiny server should then be set to `YoloHealthApp/app` under the system's R library folder where YoloHealthApp is located. The location of the system R library can be found using the `.libPaths()` R command.

Alternatively, using the default value of `site_dir`, the `inst/app` folder of this repository can be copied to `/srv/shiny-server/`. The application at `/srv/shiny-server/app` would then be available at http://myserver.org:3838/app
